- Wait for the redeployment to complete (1-2 minutes)

---

## üåê **Step 6: Access Your Website**

### 6.1 Get Your URL
- In your service dashboard, look for **"URL"** field
- It will look like: `https://dsa-problem-solver.onrender.com`
- Click the URL to open your website

### 6.2 Test Your Application
- Your homepage should load with the DSA problems list
- Try searching for a problem
- Test the AI solver functionality

---

## üìä **Step 7: Monitor Your Service**

### 7.1 Dashboard Overview
Your Render dashboard shows:
- **Status**: Green = Running, Yellow = Building, Red = Error
- **Last Deploy**: When your app was last updated
- **URL**: Your live website address
- **Logs**: Real-time application logs

### 7.2 View Logs
- Click **"Logs"** tab to see real-time output
- Useful for debugging if something goes wrong
- Shows Flask app startup and request logs

---

## üîÑ **Step 8: Automatic Updates**

### 8.1 How Auto-Deploy Works
- Every time you push to GitHub `main` branch
- Render automatically detects the change
- Starts a new build automatically
- Your website updates without manual intervention

### 8.2 Manual Deploy (if needed)
- Click **"Manual Deploy"** button
- Choose branch to deploy from
- Useful for testing different versions

---

## üö® **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### Issue 1: Build Fails
**Symptoms**: Red status, build error in logs

**Solutions**:
1. Check `requirements.txt` has all dependencies
2. Ensure `app.py` has no syntax errors
3. Verify Python version compatibility

**Common Fix**:
```bash
# In your local environment, test:
python -c "import app; print('Success')"
```

### Issue 2: App Won't Start
**Symptoms**: Build succeeds but service won't start

**Solutions**:
1. Check start command: `gunicorn app:app`
2. Verify `app.py` has `app = Flask(__name__)`
3. Check environment variables are set

### Issue 3: API Key Errors
**Symptoms**: 500 errors when using AI solver

**Solutions**:
1. Verify `GROQ_API_KEY` is set in Environment tab
2. Check API key is valid and has credits
3. Restart service after setting environment variable

### Issue 4: App Sleeps Too Much
**Symptoms**: Slow response after inactivity

**Solutions**:
1. This is normal on free tier
2. First request after sleep takes 10-30 seconds
3. Consider upgrading to paid plan for always-on service

---

## üì± **Advanced Configuration**

### Custom Domain (Optional)
1. Go to **"Settings"** ‚Üí **"Custom Domains"**
2. Add your domain (e.g., `dsasolver.com`)
3. Follow DNS configuration instructions
4. Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)

### Environment Variables for Production
Consider adding these for better performance:
```
FLASK_ENV=production
FLASK_DEBUG=false
PORT=10000
```

### Scaling (Paid Plans)
- **Starter**: $7/month - Always on, no sleep
- **Standard**: $25/month - Better performance
- **Pro**: $100/month - High performance, custom domains

---

## üìà **Performance Tips**

### Free Tier Optimization
1. **Minimize Dependencies**: Only include necessary packages
2. **Optimize Images**: Compress static assets
3. **Use CDN**: For static files (CSS, JS, images)
4. **Cache Responses**: Implement basic caching

### Monitoring
- Check **"Metrics"** tab for performance data
- Monitor response times and error rates
- Set up alerts for service downtime

---

## üéâ **Success Checklist**

After deployment, verify:
- ‚úÖ Website loads at your Render URL
- ‚úÖ DSA problems list displays correctly
- ‚úÖ Search functionality works
- ‚úÖ AI solver responds (with valid API key)
- ‚úÖ Auto-deploy works when you push to GitHub
- ‚úÖ Service stays running (green status)
